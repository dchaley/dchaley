## Independent Engineer, Software Alchemist

I'm an independent cloud architect and [software alchemist]([url](https://www.redwoodconsulting.io/about/alchemy)). 👨🏻‍🔬 🧪🔬

I help build, operate, and manage software systems.

Want some help on a short- or long-term project? I'm available! My clients range from single persons to Fortune 50 enterprises. Check out my site for more: https://www.redwoodconsulting.io/

Some projects outside my client work:

- **DeepCell AI cellular segmentation for cancer research.** [[repo](https://github.com/dchaley/deepcell-imaging)]

  I'm working with the [DiMi Lab](https://dimi-lab.github.io/) to deploy [DeepCell imaging tools] on Google Cloud. DeepCell was [developed by](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf) the Van Valen Lab at Caltech.

- **You Need A Splitter.** [[repo](https://github.com/dchaley/you-need-a-splitter)]

  I'm writing a tool for [You Need A Budget](https://www.ynab.com/) to help my personal workflow. I want to mark shared transactions as split to a certain category, but it's rather a hassle to do it by hand (especially on mobile devices). I don't intend to truly productionize this but might do. I'm also using Kotlin, transpiled to Javascript, because why not?

I'm a Google Cloud Expert, and hold a 2nd degree black belt in Seido Karate.
